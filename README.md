# Kafka Producer spike

This is just a spike i made, trying out Kafka with Spring Cloud Stream.

Not that the tests are integration-tests, and expect a kafka cluster to be up and running along with a simple schema registry

So do a: 
````docker-compose up````
before you run the tests, or they will be angry ;)
